# CalTopo + PNG map pipeline

**A report is not done until the CalTopo map AND the PNG overview are built and shipped with the markdown.** Maps and reports always go together.

Every report ships **three artifacts as one unit**:
1. `docs/peaks/<slug>.md` (or `docs/trips/<slug>.md`) — the markdown report
2. CalTopo research map (`https://caltopo.com/m/XXXXXXX`) — interactive, linked from the report header
3. `docs/maps/<slug>.png` — overview PNG embedded near the top of the report

## Pipeline

### 1. Build waypoint GPX
Generate `gpx/<slug>/<slug>_peaks_only.gpx` (summit + nearby same-objective unclimbed ranked peaks) and `<slug>_landmarks.gpx` (trailheads + key drive-in landmarks: gates, closed roads, seasonal closures). Summit + nearby-peak coords come from peak_db.

### 2. Download GPX tracks from ALL THREE sources
Not just LoJ. *"Always download the tracks from all sites not just LoJ. That's an important part of the research, finding all GPX files out there and pulling them together into one map."* (Kyle, 2026-05-29)

- **LoJ**: `/gpx/<id>.gpx` per trip report — pull every TR's GPX, each has route variations
- **14ers.com**: per-peak GPX library (`gpxlib_locator.php?peakid=<id>`) covering TR uploads + member uploads + official routes; plus per-route official GPX
- **peakbagger**: per-ascent GPX (`/climber/GPXFile.aspx?aid=<aid>&sep=1`) — **confirm logged in first** (see [source requirements](source-requirements.md))

Filename convention (keeps colors/groups distinct on upload):
```
<slug>_<author>_<year>_loj<trId>.gpx
<slug>_<author>_<year>_14ersTR<id>.gpx
<slug>_<author>_<year>_14ersGPXlib<id>.gpx
<slug>_<author>_<year>_pbAscent<aid>.gpx
```
Over-pulling is fine — the upload script dedupes identical tracks. Better to grab everything than miss a route variation.

### 3. Upload to CalTopo
```
scripts/gpx_to_caltopo.py --gpx-dir gpx/<slug> --new-map "Research: <Peak>" --no-dedupe
```
`--no-dedupe` is required for research maps so summit/peak markers always render even if they exist in other maps. Color by source: LoJ red (palette default), 14ers green (`#00AA00`), peakbagger blue (`#0066FF`). Capture the returned map ID.

### 3b. Also add the new tracks to the REGIONAL map
**Requirement (Kyle, 2026-06):** every external GPX track pulled during research goes into **two** CalTopo maps — the per-research map (above) *and* the **regional map** for the range those peaks sit in. The per-research map is the focused working view; the regional map is the durable, cumulative archive of every track for that range, built up over time across all research sessions.

```
scripts/gpx_to_caltopo.py --gpx-dir gpx/<slug> --map-id <REGIONAL_MAP_ID>
```

- Append to the existing regional map (`--map-id`, not `--new-map`).
- **Leave dedupe ON** here (omit `--no-dedupe`) — the regional map accumulates many peaks, so duplicate tracks/markers already present should be skipped. Only the per-research map needs `--no-dedupe` (so its own summit markers always render).
- Pick the regional map by the peaks' `range` field in peak_db (Sangre de Cristo, Sawatch, San Juan, Elk, Gore, Mosquito, Tenmile, etc.).
- For a multi-range objective, add to each relevant regional map.

#### Regional map registry
Regional maps follow the **"GPS Tracks — <Range>"** naming on CalTopo. Get the current list any time with `scripts/fetch_caltopo.py --list` (authoritative — don't rely on local `caltopo/*.json` dumps, which go stale after a re-render).

| Range | Regional map | CalTopo ID |
|---|---|---|
| Sangre de Cristo | GPS Tracks — Sangre De Cristo | `VKGB00L` |
| Sawatch | GPS Tracks — Sawatch | `L5VH4BU` |
| San Juan | GPS Tracks — San Juan | `06AR6BF` |
| Elk | GPS Tracks — Elk | `1G2G7DM` |
| Gore | GPS Tracks — Gore | `6E4GJV2` |
| Mosquito | GPS Tracks — Mosquito | `LECF68J` |
| Tenmile | GPS Tracks — Tenmile | `7QE01UK` |
| Front | GPS Tracks — Front | `DLES5CC` |
| Weminuche | GPS Tracks — Weminuche | `7AQN6TS` |

(Also non-CO archives: Washington, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Maine, NH, VT, NY, MA, Hawaii, Europe — same naming.)

**Coordination note:** these regional maps are maintained/re-rendered in a separate workflow. If another session is actively re-rendering one, **hold off** writing to it until that finishes (a concurrent append can be lost or conflict). Re-fetch with `fetch_caltopo.py --map <ID>` before deduping against it so the local snapshot is current.

### 4. Wire the map ID into the report
Update the header `**CalTopo research map:**` line and the caption `*[Interactive CalTopo map](https://caltopo.com/m/<id>)*`.

### 5. Render the PNG
```
scripts/make_overview_map.py <slug> --title "<Peak>"
```
Auto-renders track lines on OpenTopoMap tiles.

### 6. Commit, push, verify deploy green
Do NOT mark a peak "researched" or update the index until all three artifacts are committed and the GitHub Pages deploy succeeds.

## Imported-GPX marker handling — strip summits, gray the rest
**Requirement (Kyle, 2026-06):** trip-report GPX files arrive with their *own* embedded waypoints (the author's summit pins, camps, trailheads, junctions, water, random marks). These must not be uploaded as-is — they duplicate and clash with the climber's authoritative markers and clutter the map. On import:

1. **Summit markers → DROP, use mine.** Any imported waypoint at/near a known summit (matches a `peaks_only.gpx` summit by name, or within ~75 m of one) is discarded. The objective summits are added from `peaks_only.gpx` as **blue mountain markers — `symbol=peak`, `color=#2E78C7`** (the canonical summit scheme on the regional maps). Dedupe ON, so they're added only if not already present.
2. **All other imported markers → GRAY — `symbol=point`, `color=#9E9E9E`.** They stay on the map as useful context (camps, junctions, the TR author's trailhead) but are visually subordinated to the blue summit pins.
3. The **tracks** themselves are unaffected — still kept and colored by source (LoJ red `#FF0000` / 14ers green `#00AA00` / peakbagger blue `#0066FF`).

Net effect: one clean set of **blue mountain summit pins** + a quiet **gray** wash of secondary author waypoints, with the source-colored route lines on top.

**Exact marker scheme (matches the regional maps):**

| Marker kind | `symbol` | `color` |
|---|---|---|
| Objective summit | `peak` | `#2E78C7` (blue) |
| Any other imported waypoint | `point` | `#9E9E9E` (gray) |

> **Implementation:**
> - **New uploads:** `scripts/sync_to_regional.py` enforces the scheme (reuses `gpx_to_caltopo.py --marker-symbol`, default `point`).
> - **Normalizing existing maps:** `scripts/restyle_markers.py` rewrites every marker on a map in place via `editFeature` — summit-named or summit-located markers → `peak`/`#2E78C7`, everything else → `point`/gray. It snaps to summits from a peak-export GPX (generate one from peak_db: all CO ranked 13er+ summits). Run with `--poi-color "#9E9E9E"` to match the regional gray.
>   ```
>   scripts/restyle_markers.py --export /tmp/peakdb_summits.gpx --map <ID> --poi-color "#9E9E9E" --apply
>   ```
> - All 10 `Research:` maps + the regional maps have been normalized to this scheme (48 summit→blue, 50 POI→gray across the research maps, 2026-06-02). No more gold summit pins.

## Map waypoint scope — objective only

- **Include**: the summit(s), trailhead(s), key drive-in landmarks, and nearby unclimbed ranked 13ers+ that are *plausibly same-outing* (same drainage / ridge-connected / shared approach).
- **Exclude**: nearby peaks reached from a *different drive entirely* (opposite side of a pass/mine/wilderness boundary). Mention them in the report's cluster text if relevant, but they don't belong as map markers.
- Origin of this rule: putting Bartlett Mtn (across Climax Mine, a different drive) on the Jacque/Pennsylvania maps was noise. *"Why are you making a map for Bartlett?"* (Kyle, 2026-05-29)

## PNG framing — avoid distortion / over-zoom

The recurring failure mode: distant tracks (a TR where the peak was a minor add to another range's day, a mega-traverse, a long sub-13k outback) drag the bbox out and shrink the actual peaks to dots.

`make_overview_map.py` handles this by sizing the bbox around the **objective peak-marker bounding box + a ~1.5 mi margin** (auto-sizing: tight for one peak, spanning for a combo; floored and capped). Tracks that wander far render off-canvas — that wider context lives on the interactive CalTopo map, not the PNG.

If a PNG comes out distorted or over-zoomed, the fix is in `make_overview_map.py`'s bbox logic, **not** the GPX inputs.

> **Pending feature:** PNG track lines are currently all rendered red. Target is to color them by source (LoJ/14ers/peakbagger) like the CalTopo map, and to add automated map-QA tests (distortion / missing-track / blank-tile / aspect-ratio checks) that gate deploys.
